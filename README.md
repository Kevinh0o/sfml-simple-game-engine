# ESC Game Engine

ESC Game Engine is an **early-stage, experimental game engine** currently under active development.
It is **not complete** and **not functional yet**.

At this stage, the project mainly represents the **initial structure and direction** of the engine rather than a usable tool.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

⚠ **Important:**
The engine **does not currently work**.

This is expected.

The main blocker right now is:

* The engine depends on **SFML**, and the project needs to be updated to a newer compatible **SFML version** before it can build and run correctly.

Until that update is completed, the engine should be considered **non-runnable**.

---

## 🎯 Goals (Planned)

The long-term goal of ESC Game Engine is to provide:

* A lightweight 2D game engine
* Simple entity and scene management
* Event-driven input handling
* Rendering and window management via SFML
* A clean, modular codebase suitable for learning and experimentation

These features are **planned**, not yet implemented.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++
* **Graphics / Windowing:** SFML (version update required)
* **Build System:** *To be finalized*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

> ⚠ **Not available yet**

The engine cannot be built or run at this time due to SFML compatibility issues.
A working quick-start guide will be added once the SFML update and core systems are in place.

---

## 📌 Roadmap (Short-Term)

* [ ] Update SFML to a supported version
* [ ] Ensure the project builds successfully
* [ ] Create a game loop
* [ ] Create sprite importing features
* [ ] Initial documentation
